I am a graduate student of Computer Science at Boston University and a full-stack developer with interests in software development, system architecture, and distributed system.

In October 2020, I published my academic paper BELT: A Pipeline for Stock Price Prediction Using News (IEEE Big Data 2020, first author).

In November 2020, I interned at KuaiShou Technology Co. as a data analyst.

In April of 2022, I worked as a software development engineer intern at OPPO.

Now, I am an incoming software development engineer intern at Yahoo.

My motto: Death is more universal than life; everyone dies but not everyone lives.


Three as most important in being a successful student: (1) self-motivation, (2) perseverance, and (3) focus.
